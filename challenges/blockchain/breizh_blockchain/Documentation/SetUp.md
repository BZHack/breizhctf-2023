## Metamask

It is recommended to use Metamask and Remix for the upcoming challenges.
Add the private blockchain configuration to Metamask, as it will support all the next challenges. The configuration can be found here:

It is advised to reset your Metamask account before beginning each challenge, as a new blockchain will be utilized for each challenge. This guarantees that all local variables are reset. To proceed, launch the challenge and once you are connected to the challenge blockchain, reset your account accordingly :
